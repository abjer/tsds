    "We learned about feedforward neural networks over the last two weeks, along with most of the fundamental maths, algorithms, tricks, etc. that go into training them. Knowing how signal propagates forward, how gradients flow backwards and how weights get updates, we are now ready to release our imagination and create some deep neural networks that can do remarkable things. We will focus on two of the most **powerful architectures**, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), which have revolutionalized image recognition and sequence modeling across all fields over the last 10 years.\n",

    "The problem with feed forward images when classifying images is that the input layer looks at the whole image at the same time. Each input neuron thus becomes associated with a specific pixel, and as the network learns it may grow to expect a certain signal to emerge at that specific pixel. But if you imagine an image of a cat, features, like the whiskers, which make it cat-like are not bound to a specific *place* in the image – they can be in the centre, top corner, or any other place.\n",
    "\n",
    "CNNs solve this problem, with what's called *convolutional layers*. A convolutional input layer, for example, doesn't have a single weight for each input value. Instead, it has one or more much smaller *filters*, each one a set of input neurons (often $3 \\times 3 \\times d$ where $d$ is the depth of the input image) that gets *convolved* across the input image to produce a new image, called an *activation map*. [Here](https://github.com/vdumoulin/conv_arithmetic) are some nice gifs that illustrate different ways one can convolve a weight matrix across an input image."

To get better results, you can \"warm up\" the hidden state vectors by first running a sequence of actual Shapespeare through it and then starting generating from the last word in that sequence. Also, what I mean by \"start generating\" is that instead of predicting output from inputs drawn from your dataset, you input the prediction from the previous timestep and repeat, thus getting something that's completely made up."

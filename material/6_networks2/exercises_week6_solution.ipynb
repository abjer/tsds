We can use networks to gain various statistical insight about the system we're representing, but we can also use the network as a substrate on which to model phenomena and simulate processes. Some systems may have clusters: we can discover those by employing *community detection* algorithms. Other systems may be perfect for simulating how diseases spread.

    "Communities are little lumps of nodes in a network that are unusually strongly connected. Your family is a community, and your friend group from work or university is another community. While there is no one true definition of what a community is, there are many many different methods and algorithms for finding them. Here we will work with one of the most popular ones: [Louvain Modularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louvain_Modularity). The following exercises will walk you through the fundamentals of this method, and finally have you apply it to the network you used last week."

    "> **Ex. 6.1.1**: Assume you have a network where nodes and links tend to form lumps here and there. Imagine you now reach for your pen, and start labeling these nodes with group names (or ids) that feel appropriate according to how they are lumped together. If your partition is \"good\", nodes that are connected in groups should intuitively have the same label, while nodes that are distant and disconnected should have different labels. Modularity is a function that can be used to measure *how good* your partition is. It is in technical terms a *utility function*, and it looks like this:\n",
    "> <br><br>\n",
    "> $$ Q = \\dfrac{1}{2m}\\sum_{ij}{\\left[A_{ij}-\\dfrac{k_ik_j}{2m}\\right]\\delta(c_i, c_j)}.$$\n",
    "> <br>\n",
    "> Your job in this problem is to explain this equation. When I look at daunting math I tend to think of it as a program. Since all math can be implemented in code, all math can be broken into parts, where each part has it's own little job to perform. Answer each question below seperately:\n",
    "1. In code, a sum, $\\sum$, is like a `for` loop, where in every iteration you increment a variable. In the equation for modularity the little $ij$ subscript tells is what the sum is looping over (like `for ij in sumloop`). But what is $ij$?\n",
    "2. In each iteration of the sum, the delta function $\\delta(c_i, c_j)$ is used, where $c_i$ is the community label of node $i$. The delta function is a very simple program that returns 0 if the two input values are different and 1 if they are they same. How would you implement the delta function in code? What is it used for in the modularity equation?\n",
    "3. Inside the sum we use the term $\\frac{k_ik_j}{2m}$ as our *null model*. $k$ is the degree sequence (so $k_i$ is the degree of node $i$) and $m$ is the sum of all link weights. Explain what this null model measures. Could we have used other null models?\n",
    "4. The sum subtracts the null model from $A_{ij}$ and adds the result to its final value if the delta function evaluates to 1. What is the point of only summing over this difference when the delta function is 1?\n",
    "5. The sum term is normalized by $2m$. Why exactly $2m$?\n",
    "6. Summarize your insight gained from answering the above questions. In your own words, explain how the modularity function works. Use 1-3 sentences.\n"
